# LeetCode Problem Solutions

`*`: Required (daily problem) 
`+`: Needs Improvement (took a long time, poor performance, had to check a community submission, etc.)
`?`: Topic to Research (curious or interesting problems) 
`!`: Notably Nice or Clever Solution

2026/01/12: 1266* Easy #oneline
2026/01/13: 3453* Medium (Good test cases; 495ms <80%; first try) #heap 
2026/01/14: 3454*+? Hard (TLE) #heap ... #segtree #union
2026/01/15: 2943* Medium #sort 
2026/01/16: 2975* Medium #sort #set #bigint
2026/01/17: 3047* Medium #bruteforce #iterative
2026/01/18: 1895*+ Medium #bruteforce (My solution was pretty slow compared to the official and community best...)
2026/01/19: 1292*+ Medium #memo #iterative #prefixsum
2026/01/20: 3314*? Easy #bitwise (Nice, easy yet interesting problem)
2026/01/21: 3315*? Medium #bitwise (Same solution as yesterday, but interesting notes about a community solution that was fascinating, really genius, super clever) 
2026/01/22: 3507*+ Easy (Pathetic... once again, refusing to do the "simple" brute force approach even when it's the correct choice)
2026/01/23: 3510*! Hard #heap #linkedlist (Maybe I wasn't so dumb yesterday... SO CLOSE! to passing on first submission ... 679/681 ... Got it second try. Feeling much better about myself than after yesterday's problem.) 
2026/01/24: 1877* Medium #sort (super easy)
2026/01/25: 1984* Easy #sort
2026/01/26: 1200* Easy #sort
2026/01/27: 3650* Medium #graph
2026/01/28: 3651*? Hard #graph (i had a good approach, but missed some key optimizations and ultimately fell short, need to study this one)
2026/01/29: 2976* Medium (pretty slow brute force solution accepted on first try, very easy... building the graph more intelligently would speed up massively)
2026/01/30: 2977*+? Hard #trie #memo #graph
2026/01/31: 744* Easy #oneline
2026/02/01: 3010* Easy #heap
2026/02/02: 3013*+ Hard 
2026/02/03: 3637*! Easy #array
2026/02/04: 3640*+ Hard #array
2026/02/05: 3379* Easy #array
2026/02/06: 3634* Medium #array #bisect
2026/02/07: 1653* Medium #string
2026/02/08: 110* Easy #binarytree
