# According to the problem statement, we define costs[t][i][j] as 
# the minimum total cost to move from (i,j) to (m−1,n−1) using exactly t teleportations. 
# We consider two cases for the first move from (i,j).

# 1. Without using teleportation, you can move from (i,j) to (i+1,j) or (i,j+1). 
# The transition equation is:
# costs[t][i][j]=min(costs[t][i+1][j]+grid[i+1][j],costs[t][i][j+1]+grid[i][j+1])

# 2. Using teleportation, you can teleport to any cell (x,y) such that grid[x][y]≤grid[i][j]. 
# The transition equation is:
# costs[t][i][j]=min_{grid[x][y]≤grid[i][j]} costs[t−1][x][y]

# The second case requires computing the minimum value in costs[t−1] 
# over all cells (x,y) satisfying grid[x][y]≤grid[i][j].

# To efficiently compute this, we store all cell coordinates in points and 
# sort them in ascending order based on their grid values. We then traverse points 
# using two pointers to identify contiguous intervals [j,i] with the same grid value. 
# During the traversal, we maintain the minimum value minCost among the already visited cells
#  in costs[t−1]. For all cells points[r]=(x_{r},y_{r}) within the current interval, 
# we update their value to minCost, which effectively handles the teleportation transitions.

# Since costs[t] depends only on costs[t−1], we can eliminate the t dimension and 
# directly use a two-dimensional array costs[i][j], thereby reducing the space complexity.
